## About

Circa is *your living dictionary*. With Circa, you'll understand and apply new
words, not just memorize them. 

## Usage
* Add the words you're trying to learn in the **Dictionary** tab, and Circa will
  automatically fetch their definitions
* Use your voice to approximate definitions of your target words
* Using NLP, Circa evaluates how well you understand a word from the definition,
  and adjusts your understanding if necessary
* Spaced repetition makes words **stick**: just remember to come back and practice!
